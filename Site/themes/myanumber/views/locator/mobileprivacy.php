    <h2>What this Privacy Policy covers</h3>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to all services offered by Mya Number, LLC ("Mya
            Number"), including Mya Number Android and iOS applications. By visiting Mya
            Number's website or using Mya Number's services, you agree to this Privacy
            Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, products or services
            that are not owned or operated by Mya Number or to actions taken by Mya
            Number users. For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party
            websites or individuals who use Mya Number or to any third-party applications,
            social networks or social plug-in providers that you interact with via the Mya
            Number services, all of which are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
        <h2>Information that Mya Number collects</h2>
        <p>
            When you register for any Mya Number product or service we ask for
            information such as your name, company name, email address, billing address,
            credit card information. Mya Number uses collected information for the following
            general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and
            authentication, services improvement, contact, and research. Mya Number does
            not share your personal information with third parties, unless explicitly approved
            by you.</p>
        <p>
            When you interact with Mya Number, we may ask for your name, email
            address(es), and phone number(s). The services which Mya Number use may
            send us information about you, including your name, username at those
            services, unique user ID for those services, friends list, activity, status, profile
            information, age and gender.</p>
        <p>
            Mya Number, like most other websites, automatically collects information about
            you and your activity (known as "log data"), including your Internet Protocol (IP)
            address, your browser or device type, your interactions with Mya Number, your
            interactions with third party individuals, applications and social networks
            through Mya Number, your geographic location and Mya Number cookies
            associated with your browser. Mya Number stores and uses this log data based
            on an anonymous identifier.</p>
        <p>
            Mya Number also uses cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact
            with Mya Number services. For instance, cookies are used to provide you with a
            better Mya Number experience, to help us with our analytics, and to deliver and
            report on services that run on Mya Number. Third-party advertising companies
            may also use cookies to collect data about you for the purpose of showing
            customized advertising to you when you use our services; you can opt out of
            such customized advertising here. You can also disable cookies or otherwise
            manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with thirdparty
            software packages.</p>
        <p>
            Mya Number uses the information it collects to provide, analyze and improve the
            Mya Number services and to contact you as described under "Emails and other
            notifications."</p>
        <h2>Sharing of information</h2>
        <p>
            Mya Number may share your non-public personally identifiable information with
            third parties in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When we have your consent;</li>
            <li>Where we have a good faith belief that it is required in order to respond to
                subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, to prevent fraud or
                imminent harm, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend
                against legal claims;</li>
            <li>In order to provide certain functionality (such as abuse reporting or
                blocking of users), we may share personal information, including your user
                ID used in connection with our services, with the third party companies
                who provide certain functionality;</li>
            <li>In the event that Mya Number is acquired by or merged with another
                company or transfers substantially all of its assets to another company,
                Mya Number may transfer all of its user information and data, including
                information about you, to that other company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Mya Number may share your public information or any anonymous information
            publicly or with Mya Number's partners.</p>
