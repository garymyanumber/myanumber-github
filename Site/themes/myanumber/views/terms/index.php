    <h2>General information</h2>
    <p>The Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy and any applicable guidelines or additional
        terms posted on Mya Number constitute the entire agreement between you and
        Mya Number, govern your use of Mya Number services, and supersede any
        prior agreements between you and Mya Number relating to your use of Mya
        Number (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Use or
        Privacy Policy). If you sign up or register for additional Mya Number services
        that use third-party content or third-party software, you may also be subject to
        additional terms and conditions that apply to such third-party content or thirdparty
        software.</p>
    <p>By accessing Mya Number services you agree that the statutes and laws of the

        services, and you further agree that any litigation shall be subject to the
        exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the City and County of

        jurisdiction of those courts. The failure of Mya Number to exercise or enforce
        any right or provision of the Terms of Use does not constitute a waiver of such
        right or provision. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the
        Terms of Use to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
        endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision,
        and that the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.
        Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
        arising out of or related to use of the Mya Number services, the Terms of Use or
        the Privacy Policy must be filed within one (1) year after the event giving rise to
        such claim or cause of action or be forever barred. All headings in the Terms of
